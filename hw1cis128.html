          <p>Hi, my name is Isabella Villante. I'm 24 years old and graduated with degrees in Cognitive Science: Design & Interaction and Literature/Writing from UCSD. Now, I'm pursuing a career in UX Design and Writing with an specific interest in accessibility. When I have some extra time, I also love to read, kayak, and create new recipes to cook. I'm looking forward to starting CIS 128 and learning with everyone!

    <p>I am a non degree-seeking student and wanted to attend this course because I'm looking to expand my skills in the development side of app creation. On one end, I think it will make me a more well-rounded designer if I can create websites from scratch. On the other end, I think it will also make me a better collaborator if I'm able to understand what developers have to do to bring designs to life.
